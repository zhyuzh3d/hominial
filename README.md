# Eibanban

Eibanban is a minimal native desktop chat app built with Go and Gio. It talks to an OpenAI-compatible Responses API endpoint, supports text chat, image attachments, image generation, local memories, and SQLite-backed conversation history.

## Features

- Native cross-platform GUI with Gio
- OpenAI-compatible Responses API client with streaming support
- Image generation through the `image_generation` tool
- Image attachment upload, including SVG conversion and transparent-image white background preparation
- Click-to-preview images with zoom controls and panning
- Persistent conversation history in SQLite
- Prompt engineering context assembly from character prompt, long-term memory recall, short-term summary, recent messages, role state, user profile/context, environment context, and function schemas
- Extensible local orchestrator for model-requested function calls
- Sliding-window message loading for large local histories
- Reads Codex-style config from `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.codex/auth.json`

## Project Layout

```text
cmd/eibanban/        Application entrypoint
internal/app/        Gio UI, API client, storage, image handling, and app logic
plan/                Product requirements, architecture, and development plan
character.md         Character prompt injected into every request
memories.md          Memory document injected into every request
```

The code is kept under `internal/` because it is application-private for now. If a reusable public library emerges later, it can be promoted into `pkg/`.

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/eibanban
```

## Build

```bash
go build ./cmd/eibanban
```

## Configuration

By default, Eibanban reads the same style of configuration used by Codex:

```text
~/.codex/config.toml
~/.codex/auth.json
```

Expected auth shape:

```json
{
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
}
```

The app uses the configured `base_url` and `model`, and sends requests to the Responses API.

## Local Data

Conversation history is stored in SQLite:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/chengcheng-chat/chat.db
```

The database also stores long-term memories, short-term summaries, role state, user profile/context, environment state, prompt snapshots, tool calls, and orchestrator events.

Generated and prepared images are written under:

```text
app_outputs/
```

`app_outputs/` is ignored by Git.

## Development

Run all checks:

```bash
go test ./...
```

The upgrade plan is documented in:

```text
plan/product_requirements.md
plan/technical_architecture.md
plan/development_plan.md
```
